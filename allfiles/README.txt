welcome to my summer internship project. When I did this project I did not use Git so this is the final version I have.
ezengrtool_kylin and ezengrtool_rocky contain complete executable files running in Linux for two different systems in the company.
The whole thing is written in Python. The core graphical file is "check_deliver_tool", all the other files all subsystems or simply testing files. Sorry it really looks like a mess.
